## Mafia Game
Mafia Game Simulation Counter Strike 1.6 Plugin. Really simple menu plugin with a view to fun for Jailbreak servers.

## Rules
Plugin is accessible on map "jb_mafia" only.

There is the only Game Leader who can lead the game from beginning to the end.
To open game menu you need to use /mafia777 command. Only players with "a" flag are able to do this and only them can get the Game Leader status by press option number 1.

Then your few more options will become available.
For example you can easy block player movement or disable roulette or vips plugins(you need to specified your plugins names in the code).

Players are "City Members" by default. Game Leader is able to choose players to one of few fractions.

* The Priest - he is able to pray for one person every round. If he chooses the mafia target, player chosen to kill by Mafia survives
